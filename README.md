# clone of chess.com
 Application is a recreation of the popular online chess platform,
            Chess.com. Leveraging Vue.js for frontend development and websockets
            for real-time communication, we've ensured seamless gameplay
            experiences. Additionally, I've implemented pub-subs for efficient
            event handling and employed a stateful server to manage game states
            effectively. Clone offers all the essential features of Chess.com,
            providing users with an immersive and interactive chess-playing
            experience.
